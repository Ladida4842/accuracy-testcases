# accuracy-testcases
Certain SFC emulation test cases that were given to byuu

"hdma" tests HDMA being started mid-frame, when other channels are active or inactive at the beginning of the frame (press B to switch)

it assembles with bass

"ayaya" tests mosaic in hi-res mode (press Y to toggle mosaic) (other buttons do other unrelated things)

i honestly forgot what "m6" tests (something offset-per-tile related obviously)

"ayaya" and "m6" assemble with asar
